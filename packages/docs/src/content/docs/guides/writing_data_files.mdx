  How to write a résumé data file using the Récivi schema?
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide is for people who want to write a new résumé data file as per the
Récivi schema.

## Schema

The schema guides what the data structure of the data file looks like. Récivi
schema's root is a [résumé object](/reference/resumeschema).

## Contents

The data you include in your data file can be as little or as much as you
prefer. Most fields are optional. At it's core, only one field is required to be
in the data file, which is your name. For example, this is a perfectly valid
résumé data file.

```json
{
  "bio": {
    "name": "Dhruv Bhanushali"
  }
}
```

## Examples

We have a bunch of examples that you can refer to as starting points for your
résumé data file. You can see them on
[GitHub](https://github.com/recivi/recivi/tree/main/packages/schema/examples). We
rigorously test them to ensure that they are in sync with the schema.
