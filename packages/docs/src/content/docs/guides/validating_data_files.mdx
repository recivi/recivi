  How to validate a résumé data file against the Récivi schema?
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide is for people who want to validate their new résumé data files
against the Récivi schema. This validation is necessary to ensure that the
résumé is correct and will be properly parsed by other tools built on top of
Récivi.

## With VS Code

Using VS Code to write a résumé data file is recommended because you can get
immediate validation while writing the file and access to inline help and
documentation. VS Code comes with support for JSON schemas out of the box.

### Pre-requisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Steps

<Steps>

1. Open VS Code.
2. Create a new file and save it with a `.json` extension.

3. Define the `$schema` key in your JSON file and set it to the Récivi schema
   URL.
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://recivi.pages.dev/schemas/recivi-resume.json",
   }
   ```
4. Add the résumé data as you normally would.
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://recivi.pages.dev/schemas/recivi-resume.json",
     "bio": {
       "name": "Dhruv Bhanushali"
     }
   }
   ```
5. You can access the documentation by hovering over a key.

6. If anything is off, you will get feedback in your editor itself.

## Manual

You can write the résumé files without linting in the editor and use a separate
service to validate it.

### Pre-requisites

- A text editor
- A web browser

### Steps

<Steps>

1. Write the résumé data file in the text editor of your choice.
2. Visit [JSONSchema.dev](https://jsonschema.dev/) in the web browser of your
   choice.
3. Copy the schema from
   [its URL](https://recivi.pages.dev/schemas/recivi-resume.json) into the
   editor pane on the left.
4. Copy your data file into the editor pane on the right.
5. You can see the validation results immediately.
