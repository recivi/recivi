import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide is for people who have a résumé data file that may be hosted online
and want to build a portfolio website using the same data file.

## Pre-requisites

- Récivi data file

## Steps

<Steps>

1. [Write a Récivi data file](/guides/writing_data_files) for yourself.
2. Host the Récivi file online somewhere. For example,
   [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is one such suitable place.
3. Create a new Astro project with the template.
   ```bash
   pnpm create astro@latest -- --template recivi/portfolio
   ```
   You can also use `npm` if you prefer that.
   ```bash
   npm create astro@latest -- --template recivi/portfolio
   ```
4. Edit the `src/stores/site.ts` file and populate the fields to your liking.
   Update the `reciviUrl` field to point to your Récivi data file. The site
	 should automatically update to show the information from your data file.
5. Refer to the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) to
   further customise and build the site.
