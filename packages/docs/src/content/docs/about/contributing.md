There are so many ways to support Récivi.

:::note

I am a developer by profession, so, in the initial stages, Récivi may be focused
a bit too much on that segment. But the goal of Récivi is to be generic enough
to support a majority of résumés in a majority of fields, and to be extensible
enough to support niche use-cases via plugins.

:::

## Code

Récivi is new so there is a lot of room for it to grow and mature.

- There will be undefined behaviour, bugs and missing features. If you find
  something, file an issue so that we can look into it.
- You can help by looking into open issues and resolving them by eliminating
  undefined behaviour, fixing bugs and adding missing features.

## Usage

Récivi's network effect grows stronger when there are products that build upon
it.

- You can build renderers or themes for Récivi. You can sell them online on your
  marketplace or share them for free.
- You can build a new ATS on top of Récivi. It's quite possible that ou might
  build the first ATS not hated by its users.
- You can come up with novel use-cases for Récivi that we have not even thought
  of yet and build plugins to support them.

## Documentation

As an open schema, Récivi is largely just documentation, making it an ideal
place for contributors who like to write prose and not code.

- You can help keep our documentation accurate and up-to-date. This includes
  fixing grammatical issues and improving the content.
- If you speak more than one language, you can translate Récivi into another
  language. After all, jobs and résumés exist in all languages.

## Evangelism

If you believe in Récivi's mission, you can help us by spreading the word about
it in your circles.

- Star the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/recivi/recivi) as a gesture of
  appreciation if Récivi is useful to you.
- Write résumé data files for yourself. Prominently share your data files as
  inspiration and reference for others.
- Demand ATS vendors to support Récivi. If you work for an ATS vendor, you can
  be the change you want to see.

## Sponsor

You can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/dhruvkb), or another
contributor, to contribute to Récivi in any of the ways above.
