# Colophon

## Ideology

This site subscribes to many [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) tenets such as
data and domain ownership, open-source tools and longevity of plain text files.
It also works with [RelMeAuth](https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth) to verify domain ownership on platforms like Mastodon.

The site also focuses on progressive enhancement, using a limited amount of CSS
and little to no JavaScript. Even with both of those turned off, the experience
of using the site remains mostly intact.

## Design

### Color palette

The site's color palette comes from [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/),
specifically the Mocha and Latte variants for the dark and light modes
respectively. Catppuccin is a pastel color scheme that is easy on the eyes, and
has ports for almost every application and platform, making it easy to use
consistently for everything.

### Typography

This site uses the user's default `sans-serif` and `monospace` fonts. This decision has so many benefits:

- Not having to load web fonts makes the site faster to load, reduces bandwidth
  usage, prevents flash of unstyled text and alleviates privacy concerns.
- It doesn't patronise the user and instead gives them back their rightful
  control over their reading experience.
- In some cases like for people with dyslexia or reading difficulties, it might
  even improve accessibility.

## Technology

There is very little coding or scaffolding needed for this site. Most of the  source code is content, written in <Brand
  icon={{ name: 'mdx', title: 'MDX' }}
  anchor={{ url: 'https://mdxjs.com/' }}
  name="MDX"
/>, which is just plain ol' Markdown but with the ability to embed components.

This is possible because of both <Brand
  icon={{ name: 'astro', title: 'Astro' }}
  anchor={{ url: 'https://astro.build' }}
  name="Astro"
/> which supports MDX, handles routing etc. and the <Brand
  icon={{ pack: "pf", name: "recivi", title: "Récivi" }}
  anchor={{ url: "https://recivi.dhruvkb.dev" }}
  name="Récivi PF"
/> integration that does the rest of the heavy lifting for the site:

- It comes with all the utilities, components, layouts and pages that a
  portfolio site could possibly need.

- It provides some very neat features like favicon support, SEO meta tags, and
  Open Graph tags (including OG images) out of the box.

- It also builds both the
  <Anchor url={pathWithBase('resume')}>interactive résumé</Anchor> as well as a
  print-friendly
  <Anchor url={import.meta.env.DEV ? renderHref : pdfHref}>PDF version</Anchor>
  automatically.

- It gets all the necessary information from a single résumé data file that
  contains my personal and professional information.

## Credits

The <Brand
  icon={{ pack: "pf", name: "recivi", title: "Récivi" }}
  anchor={{ url: "https://recivi.dhruvkb.dev" }}
  name="Récivi PF"
/> integration was developed with a lot of ideas, and a little bit of code,
borrowed from the <Brand
  icon={{ pack: "custom", name: "starlight", title: "Starlight" }}
  anchor={{ url: "https://starlight.astro.build" }}
  name="Starlight"
/> integration that helps in building documentation sites.
