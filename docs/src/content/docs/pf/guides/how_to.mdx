This guide answers some common questions on how to use and customise the PF
portfolio site to your liking.

## ...add a page to the navigation menu?

Only pages with a `navIndex` field in the frontmatter are shown in the site's
navigation menu. To add a page to the navigation menu, add a `navIndex` field to
the frontmatter of the page with a number value indicating its position in the
menu. Lower numbers appear first.

## ...remove a page from the navigation menu?

To remove a page from the navigation menu, remove the `navIndex` field from the frontmatter of the page.

## ...add a page to the site?

Pages follow Astro's file-based routing. To add new pages, you must create the
directory structure inside the `src/pages/` directory matching the URL path. Any
new `.mdx` or `.astro` file will be automatically routed by Astro.

## ...remove a page from the site?

To remove a page like "Now" or "Colophon", delete the corresponding `.mdx` file
from the `src/pages/` directory. For the blog and resume pages, delete the
corresponding directory from the `src/pages/` directory.

## ...make the blog posts appear on the home page?

To make the blog posts appear on the home page, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Remove or rename the existing `src/pages/index.mdx` file. If you rename it,
   you can keep it as a separate page on a different URL.

2. Move the contents of `src/pages/blog/` out into the `src/pages/` directory.

3. Update the configuration in `astro.config.ts`, specifically `nav.dynamicPages`.

   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

   export default defineConfig({
     // ... rest of the config
     integrations: [
       pf({
         nav: {
           dynamicPages: {
             blogPost: '/posts/{slug}'
           },
         },
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```

4. Update the frontmatter of the new `src/pages/index.mdx` page:

   - Update the title of the page to "Home" (optional).
   - Remove the `navIndex` field to
     [remove it](http://localhost:4322/pf/guides/how_to/#remove-a-page-from-the-navigation-menu)
     from the navigation menu.

5. If you kept the old home page, update its frontmatter:

   - Change the title from 'Home' to something else, like "About".
   - Add the `navIndex` field to
     [add it](http://localhost:4322/pf/guides/how_to/#add-a-page-to-the-navigation-menu)
     to the navigation menu.
</Steps>
