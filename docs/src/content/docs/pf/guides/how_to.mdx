This guide answers some common questions on how to use and customise the PF
portfolio site to your liking.

## ...add a page to the navigation menu?

Only pages with a `navIndex` field in the frontmatter are shown in the site's
navigation menu. To add a page to the navigation menu, add a `navIndex` field to
the frontmatter of the page with a number value indicating its position in the
menu. Lower numbers appear first.

## ...remove a page from the navigation menu?

To remove a page from the navigation menu, remove the `navIndex` field from the frontmatter of the page.

## ...add a page to the site?

Pages follow Astro's file-based routing. To add new pages, you must create the
directory structure inside the `src/pages/` directory matching the URL path. Any
new `.mdx` or `.astro` file will be automatically routed by Astro.

## ...remove a page from the site?

To remove a page like "Now" or "Colophon", delete the corresponding `.mdx` file
from the `src/pages/` directory. For the blog and resume pages, delete the
corresponding directory from the `src/pages/` directory.
