  How to build a portfolio website using the Récivi schema?

This guide is for people who have a résumé data file that may be hosted online
and want to build a portfolio website using the same data file.

## Pre-requisites

- Récivi data file

## Steps

<Steps>

1. [Write a Récivi data file](/guides/writing_data_files) for yourself.

2. Host the Récivi file online somewhere. For example,
   [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is one such suitable place. You can
   also choose to not host it separately and rather keep it inside the portfolio
   project itself.

3. Create a new Astro project with the template.

   ```bash
   pnpm create astro@latest -- --template recivi/recivi/examples/pf
   ```

   You can also use `npm` if you prefer that.

   ```bash
   npm create astro@latest -- --template recivi/recivi/examples/pf
   ```

4. Edit the `astro.config.ts` file and populate the only required option
   `reciviDataFile`. It should point to the URL of your Récivi data file. It can
   also point to a local file using absolute path or path relative to the
   `astro.config.ts` file.

5. Further customise the site with Récivi PF's options or eject and take over
   the codebase to make it your own.
